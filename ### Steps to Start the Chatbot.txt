### Steps to Start the Chatbot

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up and start the chatbot project.

#### 1. **Set Up the Project Folder Structure**
Ensure the following folder structure is in place:

```
/chatbot_project
  /static
    index.html  <-- Place your HTML file here
  app.py         <-- Flask server code
  chatbot.py     <-- Optional, backend logic for chatbot
```

#### 2. **Install Python and Required Libraries**
Make sure Python is installed on your system. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

Next, install Flask by running this command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install flask
```

#### 3. **Write the Files**
- **`app.py`**: This file contains the Flask server logic. Copy the following code into your `app.py` file:

  ```python
  from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/")
  def home():
      return app.send_static_file('index.html')

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run(debug=True, port=5500)
  ```

- **`static/index.html`**: This file is your chatbotâ€™s frontend interface. Add your chatbot UI code here.

#### 4. **Run the Flask Server**
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory using:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/chatbot_project
   ```
3. Start the Flask server by running:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. You should see output like:
   ```
   Running on http://127.0.0.1:5500/
   ```

#### 5. **Access the Chatbot in a Browser**
- Open your web browser.
- Enter the following URL:
  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:5500/
  ```
- The chatbot interface from `index.html` should load.

#### 6. **Troubleshooting**
- If you encounter a `404 Not Found` error, ensure:
  - The `index.html` file is inside the `/static` folder.
  - Your `app.py` file points to the correct static folder.
- Restart the Flask server after making any changes to your files.

#### 7. **Optional: Modify the Chatbot Logic**
If you want to add chatbot functionality, write the logic in `chatbot.py` and integrate it into `app.py`. For example:

```python
@app.route("/chat", methods=["POST"])
def chat():
    user_message = request.json.get("message")
    response = generate_response(user_message)  # Your chatbot logic here
    return jsonify({"reply": response})
```

#### 8. **Stop the Server**
- To stop the Flask server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
